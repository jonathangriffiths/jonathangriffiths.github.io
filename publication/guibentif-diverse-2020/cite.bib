 abstract = {Somite formation is foundational to creating the vertebrate segmental body plan. Here, we describe three transcriptional trajectories toward somite formation in the early mouse embryo. Precursors of the anterior-most somites ingress through the primitive streak before E7 and migrate anteriorly by E7.5, while a second wave of more posterior somites develops in the vicinity of the streak. Finally, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are set aside for subsequent trunk somitogenesis. Single-cell profiling of T−/− chimeric embryos shows that the anterior somites develop in the absence of T and suggests a cell-autonomous function of T as a gatekeeper between paraxial mesoderm production and the building of the NMP pool. Moreover, we identify putative regulators of early T-independent somites and challenge the T-Sox2 cross-antagonism model in early NMPs. Our study highlights the concept of molecular flexibility during early cell-type specification, with broad relevance for pluripotent stem cell differentiation and disease modeling.},
