However, current approaches mostly rely on dissociating cells from tissues, thereby losing the crucial spatial context of regulatory processes. Here, we apply an image-based single-cell transcriptomics method, sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH), to detect mRNAs for 387 target genes in tissue sections of mouse embryos at the 8‚Äì12 somite stage. By integrating spatial context and multiplexed transcriptional measurements with two single-cell transcriptome atlases, we characterize cell types across the embryo and demonstrate that spatially resolved expression of genes not profiled by seqFISH can be imputed. We use this high-resolution spatial map to characterize fundamental steps in the patterning of the midbrain‚Äìhindbrain boundary (MHB) and the developing gut tube. We uncover axes of cell differentiation that are not apparent from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, such as early dorsal‚Äìventral separation of esophageal and tracheal progenitor populations in the gut tube. Our method provides an approach for studying cell fate decisions in complex tissues and development.","tags":["\"Computational biology and bioinformatics\"","\"Embryogenesis\""],"title":"Integration of spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data elucidates mouse organogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando Riveros-Mckay","Michael E.

Methods:  Using the UK Biobank resource, we developed our own polygenic risk score for coronary artery disease (CAD). We used an additional 60 000 UK Biobank individuals to develop an integrated risk tool (IRT) that combined our polygenic risk score with established risk tools (either the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology pooled cohort equations [PCE] or UK QRISK3), and we tested our IRT in an additional, independent set of 186 451 UK Biobank individuals.  Results:  The novel CAD polygenic risk score shows superior predictive power for CAD events, compared with other published polygenic risk scores, and is largely uncorrelated with PCE and QRISK3. When combined with PCE into an IRT, it has superior predictive accuracy. Overall, 10.4% of incident CAD cases were misclassified as low risk by PCE and correctly classified as high risk by the IRT, compared with 4.4% misclassified by the IRT and correctly classified by PCE. The overall net reclassification improvement for the IRT was 5.9% (95% CI, 4.7‚Äì7.0). When individuals were stratified into age-by-sex subgroups, the improvement was larger for all subgroups (range, 8.3%‚Äì15.4%), with the best performance in 40- to 54-year-old men (15.4% [95% CI, 11.6‚Äì19.3]). Comparable results were found using a different risk tool (QRISK3) and also a broader definition of cardiovascular disease. Use of the IRT is estimated to avoid up to 12 000 deaths in the United States over a 5-year period.  Conclusions:  An IRT that includes polygenic risk outperforms current risk stratification tools and offers greater opportunity for early interventions. Given the plummeting costs of genetic tests, future iterations of CAD risk tools would be enhanced with the addition of a person‚Äôs polygenic risk.","tags":["\"coronary artery disease\"","\"genetic epidemiology\"","\"genetics\"","\"primary prevention\"","\"risk factors\""],"title":"Integrated Polygenic Tool Substantially Enhances Coronary Artery Disease Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Griffiths","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Here, we describe three transcriptional trajectories toward somite formation in the early mouse embryo. Precursors of the anterior-most somites ingress through the primitive streak before E7 and migrate anteriorly by E7.5, while a second wave of more posterior somites develops in the vicinity of the streak. Finally, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are set aside for subsequent trunk somitogenesis. Single-cell profiling of T‚àí/‚àí chimeric embryos shows that the anterior somites develop in the absence of T and suggests a cell-autonomous function of T as a gatekeeper between paraxial mesoderm production and the building of the NMP pool. Moreover, we identify putative regulators of early T-independent somites and challenge the T-Sox2 cross-antagonism model in early NMPs. Our study highlights the concept of molecular flexibility during early cell-type specification, with broad relevance for pluripotent stem cell differentiation and disease modeling.","tags":["\"neuromesodermal progenitors\"","\"Brachyury\"","\"cell fate regulation\"","\"developmental trajectories\"","\"somites\""],"title":"Diverse Routes toward Early Somites in the Mouse Embryo","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593600229,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593600229,"objectID":"ec2add4a40a0c21facd621185979eff8","permalink":"https://jonathangriffiths.github.io/project/swapping/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T11:43:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/swapping/","section":"project","summary":"_swappedDrops_ is a method to correct for artefacts from barcode swapping in 10X single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Here we report the transcriptional profiles of 116,312 single cells from mouse embryos collected at nine sequential time points ranging from 6.5 to 8.5¬†days post-fertilization. We construct a molecular map of cellular differentiation from pluripotency towards all major embryonic lineages, and explore the complex events involved in the convergence of visceral and primitive streak-derived endoderm. Furthermore, we use single-cell profiling to show that Tal1-/- chimeric embryos display defects in early mesoderm diversification, and we thus demonstrate how combining temporal and transcriptional information can illuminate gene function. Together, this comprehensive delineation of mammalian cell differentiation trajectories in vivo represents a baseline for understanding the effects of gene mutations during development, as well as a roadmap for the optimization of in vitro differentiation protocols for regenerative medicine.","tags":null,"title":"A single-cell molecular map of mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536836499,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536836499,"objectID":"2734c17676377fa58232364b2f1be3a6","permalink":"https://jonathangriffiths.github.io/talk/10x-genomics-user-group-meeting-paris/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T12:01:39+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/10x-genomics-user-group-meeting-paris/","section":"event","summary":"How we used the 10X platform to build the mouse gastrulation atlas, and how we corrected for common artefacts (doublets, etc.) produced by the system.","tags":[],"title":"10x Genomics User Group Meeting - Paris","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jonathan A.
