Methods This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank (UKB) resource. We developed our own polygenic risk score (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD), using novel and established methods to combine published genomewide association study (GWAS) data with data from 114,196 UK Biobank individuals, also leveraging a large resource of other GWAS datasets along with functional information, to aid in the identification of causal variants, and thence define weights for \u0026gt; 8M genetic variants. We utilised a further 60,000 UKB individuals to develop an integrated risk tool (IRT) that combined our PRS with established risk tools (either the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology9s pooled cohort equations (PCE) or the UK9s QRISK3) which was then tested in an additional, independent, set of 212,563 UKB individuals. We evaluated prediction performance in individuals of European ancestry, both as a whole and stratified by age and sex. Findings The novel CAD PRS showed superior predictive power for CAD events, compared to other published PRSs. As an individual risk factor, it has similar predictive power to each of systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, but is more predictive than total cholesterol and smoking history. Our novel CAD PRS is largely uncorrelated with PCE, QRISK3, and family history, and, when combined with PCE into an integrated risk tool, had superior predictive accuracy. In individuals reclassified as high risk, CAD event rates were markedly and significantly higher compared to those reclassified as low risk. Overall, 9.7% of incident CAD cases were misclassified as low risk by PCE and correctly classified as high risk by the IRT, in contrast to 3.7% misclassified by the IRT and correctly classified by PCE. The overall net reclassification improvement for the IRT was 5.7% (95% CI 4.4-7.0), but when individuals were stratified into four age-by-sex subgroups the improvement was larger for all subgroups (range 7.7%-17.3%), with best performance in younger middle-aged men aged 40-54yo (17.3%, 95% CI 13.0-21.5). Broadly similar results were found using a different risk tool (QRISK3), and also for cardiovascular disease events defined more broadly. Interpretation An integrated risk tool that includes polygenic risk outperforms current, clinical risk stratification tools, and offers greater opportunity for early interventions. Given the plummeting costs of genetic tests, future iterations of CAD risk tools would be enhanced with the addition of a person9s polygenic risk.

Here we report the transcriptional profiles of 116,312 single cells from mouse embryos collected at nine sequential time points ranging from 6.5 to 8.5 days post-fertilization. We construct a molecular map of cellular differentiation from pluripotency towards all major embryonic lineages, and explore the complex events involved in the convergence of visceral and primitive streak-derived endoderm. Furthermore, we use single-cell profiling to show that Tal1-/- chimeric embryos display defects in early mesoderm diversification, and we thus demonstrate how combining temporal and transcriptional information can illuminate gene function. Together, this comprehensive delineation of mammalian cell differentiation trajectories in vivo represents a baseline for understanding the effects of gene mutations during development, as well as a roadmap for the optimization of in vitro differentiation protocols for regenerative medicine.","tags":null,"title":"A single-cell molecular map of mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536836499,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536836499,"objectID":"cc006d51c18966700265ce6de8e14a62","permalink":"https://jonathangriffiths.github.io/talk/10x_paris/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T12:01:39+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/10x_paris/","section":"talk","summary":"How we used the 10X platform to build the mouse gastrulation atlas, and how we corrected for common artefacts (doublets, etc.) produced by the system.","tags":[],"title":"10x Genomics User Group Meeting - Paris","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jonathan A.

However, cellular decision‐making is inherently a unicellular process to which “bulk” ‐omics techniques are poorly suited, as they capture ensemble averages of cell states. Recently developed single‐cell methods bridge this gap, allowing high‐throughput molecular surveys of individual cells. In this review, we cover core concepts of analysis of single‐cell gene expression data and highlight areas of developmental biology where single‐cell techniques have made important contributions. These include understanding of cell‐to‐cell heterogeneity, the tracing of differentiation pathways, quantification of gene expression from specific alleles, and the future directions of cell lineage tracing and spatial gene expression analysis.","tags":["cell fate","development","differentiation","single‐cell RNA‐seq","transcriptome"],"title":"Using single‐cell genomics to understand developmental processes and cell fate decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521471362,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521471362,"objectID":"c8c20bda4cba0470204d4f344b75de3a","permalink":"https://jonathangriffiths.github.io/talk/masamb_standrews/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T14:56:02Z","relpermalink":"/talk/masamb_standrews/","section":"talk","summary":"A description of the phenomenon of barcode swapping, and how it can be efficiently remedied in droplet single-cell RNA-seq data.","tags":[],"title":"MASAMB 2018","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jonathan A.
